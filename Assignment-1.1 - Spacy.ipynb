  copyright 1889 by john d quackenbosprefacethe history of literature as a separate branch of the history ofcivilization is of comparatively recent origin the first work onthe subject in any language dating no further back than the sixteenthcentury and being little more than a crude catalogue of authors andtheir books yet who can deny the great importance of such historywhen studied in connection with illustrative extracts from themasterpieces of which it treats it furnishes a key to the intellectualdevelopment of our race introduces us to the great minds that standas beacon lights in successive ages and with their wisdom widensthe scope of knowledge while it refines the taste and disciplinesthe judgment lord bacon said but the truth when he remarked thatthe history of the world without the history of letters would be asincomplete as a statue of polyphemus deprived of his single eyenor is this study without results of a direct practical bearingcertainly all must appreciate the importance of understanding currentallusions to the writers and literary works of other ages andcountries and must admit that some acquaintance at least with suchwriters and works is essential to a wellgrounded knowledge of one’sown language and a correct estimate of its literature but when issuch an acquaintance to be obtained if not during a school or collegecourse the engrossing duties of afterlife leave little time forthe pursuit of liberal studies and how is such an acquaintance tobe obtained all are not linguists and the greater part must get itsecondhand—must avail themselves of the labors of others who havedelved in these unfamiliar fieldsit is to facilitate and popularize this study of general literature byfurnishing a complete and carefully condensed textbook on the subjectunencumbered by obscure names and wearisome details that the volumenow offered to the public has been prepared it presents a full accountof the literatures of ancient nations and treating of the originand relationships of their respective languages incidentally bringsforward some of the most interesting facts of comparative philologywhile the writings of greece and rome receive due attention a newand it is believed peculiarly valuable feature of the book will befound in its treatment of ancient oriental literature—particularlythe sanscrit and persian the labors of european scholars during thelast quartercentury have thrown a chain of living interest around thesubject and awakened on this side of the atlantic as well a thirstfor further knowledge which it is here attempted to satisfy theprinciples of egyptian writing are also explained and the literarytreasures recently unearthed amid the ruins of the nile valley andelsewhere are described and illustratedin treating the subject the author has aimed while giving a clearoutline of each literature as a whole to make its great writers standout in bold relief and to associate them in the pupil’s mind with

account of themselves sculptured on rocks orthe walls of crumbling temples but by careful study of the languagesof aryan origin we obtain after the lapse of four thousand years aglimpse of the social condition of those who spoke the mothertongueamong the mountains of bactria we infer that nouns similar in thevarious derived languages—as father protector brother helperhouse door walls boat grain etc—are the names of objects ornotions familiar to the original family1 thus utilizing languageas a key to what would otherwise be locked up in the unknown pastwe learn that the inhabitants of the fertile bactrian valleys weredevoted to agricultural pursuits tilling the ground was an honorableemployment the very name aryan signifying highborn noble wehave pictured to us lawabiding communities grouped together in townsruled by chiefs and a king recognizing family ties entertainingexalted conceptions of woman and a solemn regard for the marriagebond—the latter always a mark of high

some of our commonest stories are derivedfrom fables current at least two thousand years bc in ancient arya=aryan migrations=—few in number at first the aryans long livedpeaceably together but as the population grew denser great bodieseither compelled to search for food in other lands or moved by a thirstfor exploration broke away at different periods from the cradle oftheir race in quest of new abodesamong these emigrants were teutonic lithuanian and slavonianhordes who pushed to the northwest and became the ancestors of thescandinavian and german nations the letts russians and poles
